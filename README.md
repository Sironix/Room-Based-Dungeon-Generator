# Room Based Dungeon Generator
 Uses rooms created by the user, to create a randomly generated dungeon, with rules and checks for door coonections. rooms can have an id to link to a real room scene, to create the real dungeon, this is just an abstraction that lets you do the generation of the dungeon itself
 
This was done in godot 4.3 just in case.
